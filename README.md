This repository contains an Excel dashboard that demonstrates my expertise in Excel data analysis and visualization. The dashboard is based on the [Superstore Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohitsahoo/sales-forecasting) from Kaggle. The dashboard provides insights into sales trends, shipping modes, product categories, geographic distribution, and more.

</p>

The "Add New Order" feature enhances data input and streamlines the addition of new orders. Clicking the "Add New Order" button opens this Userform, where users can enter order details, including customer information, product, quantity, and pricing. The Userform ensures data consistency and appends the new order details to the master data sheet.


## Dynamic Filtering with Slicers

The Excel dashboard includes interactive slicers that allow users to dynamically filter and analyze the data. There are three slicers in the dashboard:

1. **Month and Year Slicer:** This slicer enables users to filter the dashboard based on specific months and years. Users can choose a desired combination of month and year to view sales data for that period.

2. **Customer Category Slicer:** The customer category slicer allows users to filter the data based on different customer categories. This provides insights into sales trends specific to different customer segments.

3. **Product Category Slicer:** Users can also filter the dashboard by product categories. This slicer provides the ability to focus on specific product categories and analyze their performance.

By utilizing these slicers, users can tailor their analysis and insights according to their preferences. The dynamic filtering capability enhances the dashboard's interactivity and usability, making it easy to explore different aspects of the data.

The slicers were added using Excel's built-in slicer functionality and are connected to the relevant pivot tables and charts. This dynamic feature underscores my proficiency in Excel and highlights the actionable insights that can be derived from the data.
